/* About my choice of styling for this page */

//In this project, I've opted to utilize Styled Components, CSS modules, and SCSS SASS for styling. My intention is to enhance and showcase the skills I've gained during my internship. However, I'm aware that this approach might not be recommended for a real-world project. It could potentially lead to confusion among developers working on the project. To maintain organization, I'm incorporating SCSS in global CSS for tasks such as responsiveness. For reusable components, I'm using Styled Components, while CSS modules are employed for individual components that are used only once.
